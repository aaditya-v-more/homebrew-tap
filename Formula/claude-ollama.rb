  # Both scripts are pure stdlib — bash and whatever python3 the machine already
  # has, which on macOS means the Command Line Tools copy. Pulling in a keg of
  # Python to run a 400-line proxy would be the larger dependency by far.

    bin.install "bin/claude-ollama"
    bin.install "bin/claude-ollama-pace"

    # The app bundle is a launcher, not a program: a Dock icon that calls the
    # wrapper. It lives in the keg and is linked into ~/Applications by
    # `claude-ollama install-app`, which is the user's call to make.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Two things are still yours to do:

        claude-ollama install-app   links "Claude (Ollama).app" into ~/Applications
        claude-ollama doctor        checks the gateway, proxy, bundle and profile

      This drives an existing Claude Desktop install at /Applications/Claude.app
      and an Ollama gateway on 127.0.0.1:11435 — it does not install either.
